            Aurthohin is a Bangladeshi rock band formed in Dhaka in 1998 by Saidus Sumon (vocals and bass guitar), Tonmoy Rahman (lead guitar), Ponir (rhythm guitar) and Rumi Rahman (drums and percussion). They are considered to be one of the pioneering band in Bangladeshi
            alternative rock music. They have released 7 studio albums and also have appeared in some mixed albums. Though they were formed as a rock band they have experimented with genres like progressive metal and groove metal.[1][2] Sumon's interests
            in slap bass also led the band's sound into funk-rock.[citation needed] After signing with G-Series, they released their debut studio album Trimatrik|ত্রিমাত্রিক (Three-Dimensional) in October 7, 2000. The following album Biborton|বিবর্তন
            (Evolution) released on December 10, 2001 was more positively reviewed and gained more success than the previous one. The band released several hit songs in the 2000s like "অদ্ভুত সেই ছেলেটি (That Weird Boy)" (2000), "আমার প্রতিচ্ছবি (My Reflections)"
            (2001), "হয়তোবা (Maybe)" (2003), "আনমনে (Absently)" (2008) and "নিকৃষ্ট (Inferior)" (2008). Their most commercially successful album Aushomapto 2|অসমাপ্ত ২ (Unfinished II) was released on October 7, 2011 by ME Label. Their sound was drawn
            from variety of musical influences including alternative, blues and also the country music of John Denver. There were several lineup changes, with Sumon being the only member who remained throughout the band's career. They have also won many
            awards including Channel i and Citycell’s best band of the year award in 2008 and 2011 respectively.
